This program will read a list of imgur album hashes and download a random image from a random album.
Config file should be stored under ~/.config/artthief/albums.conf
The list should contain imgur album hashes separated by newline.
I.e. if the imgur link is `https://imgur.com/a/A123BC456` the entry should contain only `A123BC456`
